TDIDT: BASIC ALGORITHM
IF all the instances in the training set belong to the same class
THEN return the value of the class
ELSE 
(a) Select an attribute A to split on+
(b) Sort the instances in the training set into subsets, one
for each value of attribute A
(c) Return a tree with one branch for each non-empty subset,
each branch having a descendant subtree or a class
value produced by applying the algorithm recursively
+ Never select an attribute twice in the same branch
